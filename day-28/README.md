## Day 28

Pomodoro Project:
"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks." - Wikipedia

Need to fix:
1) Make window pop-up infront of all windows closer to 00:00 on the timer
